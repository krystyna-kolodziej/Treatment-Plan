# Instructions for Adding Treatment Guidelines

## Basic Formatting Rules

When adding new guidelines, follow these key formatting principles:

### Header Structure
1. Main Category (System) - Use # (one hashtag)
2. Subcategory - Use ## (two hashtags)
3. Specific Condition - Use ### (three hashtags)

### Standard Protocol Format

Each condition should be formatted as follows:

1. Start with condition name as a header
2. List trigger conditions under "When:"
3. Number each protocol step
4. Use bullet points for details under each step

Example:
### [Condition Name]
**When: [List trigger conditions]**
1. Initial Approach:
   - Treatment: dosage and frequency
   - Monitoring requirements

2. If No Improvement:
   - Next step treatment
   - Timeline for progression

## Required Elements for Each Guideline

Every new guideline entry must include:

1. Clear Trigger Conditions
   - Specific lab values
   - Symptoms
   - Other clinical indicators

2. Treatment Details
   - Exact medication/supplement names
   - Specific dosages
   - Administration frequency
   - Timing considerations

3. Monitoring Requirements
   - Which labs to check
   - Frequency of monitoring
   - Target values

4. Progression Criteria
   - When to advance treatment
   - What indicates success
   - When to try alternative approaches

## Example of a Well-Formatted Guideline

Here's how a complete guideline should look:

### Insulin Resistance with Inflammation
**When: Elevated HbA1c >5.7% AND hs-CRP >3.0**

1. Primary Protocol:
   - Metformin: 500mg BID with meals
   - Berberine: 500mg TID with meals
   
2. Anti-Inflammatory Support:
   - EPA/DHA: 3g daily
   - Curcumin: 1000mg daily
   
3. Monitoring:
   - HbA1c every 3 months
   - hs-CRP every 3 months
   - Fasting insulin monthly

4. Progression Criteria:
   - If no improvement after 3 months
   - If hs-CRP remains >3.0

## Best Practices

### Organization
- Keep related conditions together
- Use consistent header levels
- Maintain logical progression
- Add new content at the end of relevant sections

### Clarity
- Be specific with values
- Include units
- Define any specialized terms
- Use consistent terminology

### Updates
- Don't delete existing guidelines without discussion
- Note any major changes
- Maintain version consistency

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Formatting Issues
   - Mixed formatting styles
   - Inconsistent header levels
   - Missing blank lines between sections

2. Content Issues
   - Missing monitoring requirements
   - Vague dosage instructions
   - Unclear progression criteria
   - Inconsistent units

## Before Adding New Guidelines

Check that your addition:

1. Follows the Standard Format
   - Correct header structure
   - Consistent bullet points
   - Proper numbering

2. Includes All Required Information
   - Clear trigger conditions
   - Specific dosages
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Progression criteria

3. Maintains Consistency
   - Uses same units as existing guidelines
   - Follows established terminology
   - Matches existing style
