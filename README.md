A comprehensive system for generating evidence-based treatment plans using standardized clinical guidelines. This system integrates laboratory results, patient context, and established treatment protocols to create structured, consistent treatment recommendations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Copy both the prompt AND treatment guidelines
2. Format your input using the template below
3. Paste everything into Claude in this order:
   - Prompt
   - Treatment Guidelines
   - Patient Information
4. Receive a structured treatment plan

## üìã System Components

1. **Prompt (`prompt.md`)**
   - Core logic for analysis
   - Input requirements
   - Output formatting rules
   - Guidelines integration logic

2. **Treatment Guidelines (`treatment-guidelines.md`)**
   - Standardized protocols
   - Intervention thresholds
   - Treatment progressions
   - Monitoring requirements
