# Clinical Resources and Implementation Guide

## Laboratory Protocols & Guidelines

### General Lab Requirements
- Draw within 4 hours of waking
- 12-hour fasting period
- Minimum 32oz fluid intake
- Men: Avoid orgasm 24hrs before test (affects Prolactin)
- Premenopausal women: Test days 20-23 of cycle
- Avoid biotin supplementation
- If on TRT: Draw before injection

### Biotin Impact on Lab Values
