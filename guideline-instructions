# Instructions for Adding Treatment Guidelines

## Basic Formatting Rules

1. Use Markdown Headers:
```markdown
# Main Category (e.g., System)
## Subcategory
### Specific Condition
```

2. Standard Protocol Format:
```markdown
### [Condition Name]
**When: [List trigger conditions]**
1. Initial Approach:
   - Treatment: dosage and frequency
   - Monitoring requirements

2. If No Improvement:
   - Next step treatment
   - Timeline for progression
```

## Template Structures

### Basic Protocol Template:
```markdown
### [Condition Name]
**When: [Lab values or symptoms that trigger this protocol]**
1. Primary Protocol:
   - Medication/Supplement: dosage
   - Additional treatment: details
   
2. Support Protocol:
   - Supporting treatments
   - Monitoring needs

3. Progression Criteria:
   - When to move to next step
   - What to monitor
```

### Complex Protocol Template:
```markdown
### [Condition Name]
**When: [Multiple trigger conditions]**

**Severity Level 1:**
1. Initial Approach:
   - Treatment A: dosage
   - Treatment B: dosage

2. Monitoring:
   - Lab tests
   - Frequency
   - Target values

**Severity Level 2:**
[Follow same structure]
```

### Combination Protocol Template:
```markdown
### [Combined Conditions]
**When: [Multiple conditions present]**
1. Primary Focus:
   - Main treatment
   - Priority order

2. Integration Notes:
   - How treatments interact
   - Timing considerations

3. Monitoring:
   - Combined markers
   - Frequency
```

## Required Elements

Every guideline entry should include:
1. Clear trigger conditions
2. Specific dosages/frequencies
3. Monitoring requirements
4. Progression criteria
5. Target outcomes

## Example of Adding New Guideline

Original:
```markdown
### Metabolic Health
[existing content]
```

Adding New Section:
```markdown
### Metabolic Health
[existing content remains]

### Insulin Resistance with Inflammation
**When: Elevated HbA1c >5.7% AND hs-CRP >3.0**
1. Primary Protocol:
   - Metformin: 500mg BID with meals
   - Berberine: 500mg TID with meals
   
2. Anti-Inflammatory Support:
   - EPA/DHA: 3g daily
   - Curcumin: 1000mg daily
   
3. Monitoring:
   - HbA1c every 3 months
   - hs-CRP every 3 months
   - Fasting insulin monthly

4. Progression Criteria:
   - If no improvement after 3 months
   - If hs-CRP remains >3.0
```

## Best Practices

1. Organization:
   - Keep related conditions together
   - Use consistent header levels
   - Maintain logical progression

2. Clarity:
   - Be specific with values
   - Include units
   - Define terms if needed

3. Updates:
   - Add new content at the end of relevant sections
   - Don't delete old guidelines without discussion
   - Note any major changes

4. Formatting:
   - Use bullet points for lists
   - Number steps in procedures
   - Include blank lines between sections

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. DON'T:
   - Mix different formats within same condition
   - Leave out monitoring requirements
   - Skip progression criteria
   - Use inconsistent units

2. DO:
   - Double-check your formatting
   - Include all required elements
   - Maintain consistent style
   - Add reference ranges

## Questions to Answer Before Adding

   - Note any contraindications?

2. Is it organized with:
   - Correct header levels?
   - Consistent formatting?
   - Clear progression steps?
   - All required elements?
