# Instructions for Adding Treatment Guidelines

## Basic Formatting Rules

When adding new guidelines, follow these key formatting principles:

### Header Structure
1. Main Category (System) - Use # (one hashtag)
2. Subcategory - Use ## (two hashtags)
3. Specific Condition - Use ### (three hashtags)

### Standard Protocol Format

Each condition should be formatted as follows:

1. Start with condition name as a header
2. List trigger conditions under "When:"
3. Number each protocol step
4. Use bullet points for details under each step

Example:
### [Condition Name]
**When: [List trigger conditions]**
1. Initial Approach:
   - Treatment: dosage and frequency
   - Monitoring requirements

2. If No Improvement:
   - Next step treatment
   - Timeline for progression

## Required Elements for Each Guideline

Every new guideline entry must include:

1. Clear Trigger Conditions
   - Specific lab values
   - Symptoms
   - Other clinical indicators

2. Treatment Details
   - Exact medication/supplement names
   - Specific dosages
   - Administration frequency
   - Timing considerations

3. Monitoring Requirements
   - Which labs to check
   - Frequency of monitoring
   - Target values

4. Progression Criteria
   - When to advance treatment
   - What indicates success
   - When to try alternative approaches

## Example of a Well-Formatted Guideline
